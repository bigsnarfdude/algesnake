✅ You COULD implement merge operations for these structures

1. MinHash LSH
--------------
Current: ❌ No aggregation
Could support? ⚠️ YES, with caveats

How it would work:
- Merge hash tables bucket by bucket
- Combine candidate lists
- Requires matching parameters (b, r, threshold)

Challenges:
- Bucket collisions need handling
- Duplicate keys across indexes
- Parameters must match exactly
- O(buckets) complexity

Example of what COULD be implemented:
    lsh1 = MinHashLSH(threshold=0.7, num_perm=128)
    lsh2 = MinHashLSH(threshold=0.7, num_perm=128)
    # ... insert data ...

    # Hypothetical merge:
    merged_lsh = lsh1.merge(lsh2)  # Not implemented!

Why not implemented:
- If you can merge two LSH indexes, you already have the MinHash sketches
- Better to aggregate MinHashes first, then build one LSH
- Merging adds complexity with minimal benefit


2. LSH Forest
-------------
Current: ❌ No aggregation
Could support? ⚠️ MAYBE, but very complex

How it would work:
- Merge prefix trees
- Reconcile different tree structures
- Rebuild index from merged data

Challenges:
- Trees have different structures based on insertion order
- Merging trees is not trivial
- Better to rebuild from scratch

Why not implemented:
- Tree merging is O(n log n) anyway
- Same cost as rebuilding from aggregated sketches
- More complex to implement correctly


3. LSH Ensemble
---------------
Current: ❌ No aggregation
Could support? ⚠️ MAYBE, with significant work

How it would work:
- Merge size-partitioned data
- Reconcile partition boundaries
- Merge LSH indexes within each partition

Challenges:
- Partitions have different size ranges
- Each partition has different (b, r) parameters
- Very complex to align partitions from different indexes

Why not implemented:
- Partition boundaries might not align
- Too complex for marginal benefit
- Better to reaggregate and repartition


4. HNSW
-------
Current: ❌ No aggregation
Could support? ❌ VERY DIFFICULT

How it would work:
- Merge hierarchical graphs
- Reconcile entry points
- Merge layer structures

Challenges:
- Random level assignments differ between graphs
- Entry points are different
- Graph topology is complex
- Merging graphs is a research problem

Why not implemented:
- Graph merging is extremely complex
- No standard algorithm exists
- Academic research area
- Building new graph is simpler

print("""
Reason 1: You Already Have the Sketches
----------------------------------------
If you have two LSH indexes to merge, you already have the MinHash sketches.
Better to merge sketches (cheap) then rebuild index (one-time cost).

❌ Bad: Merge indexes
    lsh1 = build_lsh(sketches1)
    lsh2 = build_lsh(sketches2)
    merged = lsh1.merge(lsh2)  # Complex!

✅ Good: Merge sketches
    all_sketches = sketches1 + sketches2  # Cheap monoid operation
    lsh = build_lsh(all_sketches)  # Build once


Reason 2: Complexity vs. Benefit
---------------------------------
Merging indexes adds significant complexity for minimal practical benefit.

Complexity: HIGH
- Handle mismatched parameters
- Merge complex data structures
- Deal with duplicates and collisions
- Maintain correctness guarantees

Benefit: LOW
- You still need the underlying sketches
- Building from scratch is often faster
- Simpler code, fewer bugs


Reason 3: Real-World Usage Patterns
------------------------------------
In practice, you either:

Pattern A: Batch Processing
- Collect all data
- Aggregate sketches
- Build index once
→ No need for index merging

Pattern B: Incremental Updates
- New data arrives
- Rebuild index periodically (e.g., hourly)
→ Full rebuild is fine

Pattern C: Distributed Search
- Multiple indexes on different servers
- Query all, merge results
→ Don't merge indexes, merge query results


Reason 4: Performance
----------------------
Index merging complexity:
- MinHash LSH merge: O(buckets + items)
- Rebuild from sketches: O(items * log items)

Often similar cost, but rebuild is simpler and more reliable.

print("""
Scenario 1: Massive Scale, Rare Updates
----------------------------------------
- Billions of items indexed
- Very rare updates (monthly)
- Building from scratch takes days
→ Index merging MIGHT be worth the complexity

But even here, alternatives are better:
- Incremental LSH (research topic)
- Multiple indexes + federated search
- Approximate index updates


Scenario 2: Distributed Index Sharding
---------------------------------------
- Index split across 100 servers
- Want single unified view
→ Better: Query all shards, merge results

Don't merge indexes, merge query results:
    results = []
    for shard in shards:
        results.extend(shard.query(query))
    return top_k(results)


Scenario 3: Online Learning / Streaming
----------------------------------------
- Continuous data stream
- Can't rebuild from scratch
→ Better: Sliding window of sketches

Maintain window of aggregated sketches:
    window = [sketch_hour1, sketch_hour2, ..., sketch_hour24]
    current = sum(window)
    lsh = build_lsh(current)  # Rebuild hourly

YES - If there's demand, I could add:

class MinHashLSH:
    def merge(self, other: 'MinHashLSH') -> 'MinHashLSH':
        '''Merge two LSH indexes (experimental).'''
        if self.threshold != other.threshold:
            raise ValueError("Thresholds must match")
        if self.num_perm != other.num_perm:
            raise ValueError("num_perm must match")

        result = MinHashLSH(self.threshold, self.num_perm)

        # Merge hash tables
        for i in range(self.b):
            for hash_val, keys in self.hashtables[i].items():
                result.hashtables[i][hash_val].extend(keys)
            for hash_val, keys in other.hashtables[i].items():
                result.hashtables[i][hash_val].extend(keys)

        # Merge stored MinHashes
        result.minhashes.update(self.minhashes)
        result.minhashes.update(other.minhashes)
        result.keys.update(self.keys)
        result.keys.update(other.keys)

        return result

But this requires:
- Careful duplicate handling
- Parameter validation
- Thorough testing
- Documentation of limitations

And the benefit is questionable since you already have the sketches.

For 99% of use cases, the current pattern is optimal:

✅ PATTERN: Sketch → Aggregate → Index

    # Stage 1: Distributed sketch collection
    server1_sketches = {...}  # Dict of MinHash
    server2_sketches = {...}
    server3_sketches = {...}

    # Stage 2: Aggregate sketches (cheap, monoid operation)
    all_sketches = {}
    for key in all_keys:
        sketches = [s1[key], s2[key], s3[key]]
        all_sketches[key] = sum(sketches)  # ✅ Fast O(k)

    # Stage 3: Build index once (one-time cost)
    lsh = MinHashLSH(threshold=0.7, num_perm=128)
    for key, sketch in all_sketches.items():
        lsh.insert(key, sketch)

    # Stage 4: Query
    results = lsh.query(query_sketch)


Why this is better than merging indexes:
1. Simpler code
2. Fewer edge cases
3. More maintainable
4. Industry standard
5. Leverages monoid properties where they matter (sketches)


When to rebuild index:
- New data arrives: Aggregate new sketches, rebuild
- Periodic updates: Rebuild daily/hourly
- Parameter changes: Must rebuild anyway

Cost: O(n log n) - acceptable for most applications

Can indexes support aggregation?
→ Technically YES, but NOT IMPLEMENTED (by design)

Why not implemented?
→ High complexity, low benefit, not standard practice

What should you do?
→ Use the Sketch → Aggregate → Index pattern

Should I add index merging?
→ Only if you have a compelling use case that requires it
→ For 99% of users, current design is optimal

Bottom line:
✅ Sketches are monoids (aggregate them!)
❌ Indexes are not monoids (rebuild them!)
✅ This is the right design choice
